# Installation

## Tooling

Your Node.js tooling must satisfy the following version requirements:

- `npm` >= 8.1.0
- `node` >= 16

## Install

With the appropriate versions of `node`/`npm` in use:

```bash
npm install
```

If you need to start fresh after much messing about, the `reinstall` script
deletes `./node_modules/` and then installs:

```bash
npm run reinstall
```
