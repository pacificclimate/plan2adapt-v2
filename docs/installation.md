# Installation

You should use a recent version of `npm`. Older versions (< 5.5.1) may
not install all required dependencies correctly.

With the appropriate versions of `node`/`npm` in use:

```bash
npm install
```

If you need to start fresh after much messing about, the `reinstall` script
deletes `./node_modules/` and then installs:

```bash
npm run reinstall
```
