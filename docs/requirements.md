# Requirements

## Execution environment

Node.js >= 9.2.0 (**important**)

All other package requirements are specified in `package.json`.

We **strongly** recommend using [`nvm`](https://github. com/creationix/nvm) 
to manage your `node`/`npm` install. In particular, you will have 
trouble finding later versions of Node.js in standard Linux installs;
`nvm` however is up to date with all recent releases.

Note: Avoid `snap` packages. Experience to date suggests it does not 
result in stable, reliable installations.
