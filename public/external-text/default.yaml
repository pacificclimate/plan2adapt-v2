      The table below shows projected changes in average (mean) temperature,
      precipitation and several derived climate variables from the
      baseline historical period
      (${baselineTimePeriod.start_date}-${baselineTimePeriod.end_date})
      to the
      ${futureDecade}s (${futureTimePeriod.start_date}-${futureTimePeriod.end_date})
      for the ${region.properties.english_na} region.
      The ensemble median is a mid-point value, chosen from a PCIC standard
      set of Global Climate Model (GCM) projections (see the 'Notes' tab for
      more information).
      The range values represent the lowest and highest results within the set.

    label: Impacts
    prologue: |
      Below, you can view a list of potential impacts that may affect
      ${region.properties.english_na} in the ${futureDecade}s.
      This is intended to provide a starting point for more detailed local
      assessment of climate change impacts.
      These are based on limited climate change information, as shown in the
      detailed rules logic.
      These rules were developed based on a workshop attended by climate
      impacts experts and subsequent review in 2012.
      Although quite comprehensive, the rules are a work in progress, and some
      key impacts or management implications may be missing.
      We are planning a literature review and update to these rules in light of
      newer impacts research and the availability of additional indices.
    rulesLogic:
      prologue: |
        The table below shows all of the rules used to determine whether to
        display specific impacts and specific management implications in the
        Impacts tab. This preliminary compilation of rules was developed based
        on a workshop attended by climate impacts experts and subsequent peer
        review. They are fairly technical and quite a bit of shorthand is used,
        as described under terminology below. Although quite comprehensive,
        the rules are a work in progress, and some key impacts or management
        implications may be missing. We welcome contributions and suggestions
        from users of Plan2Adapt.

        There are two types of rules: internal rules and impacts rules.
        The internal rules, listed first below, are used as part of the
        conditions in many other rules, with additional information given
        under the management implications column. The internal rule "snow",
        for example, is true if a region has locations with hydrological regimes
        that would be classified as snowfall-dominated based on the 1961-1990
        climatology. This is determined by the condition of whether any
        50km cells within the selected region have mean winter temperatures
        below -6°C. The "hybrid" and "rain" rules are similar but for hybrid
        and rain-dominated classifications. Note that a region may have
        locations that meet multiple classifications.
        The "future-..." internal rules make the same determination about the
        region in the selected future time period.

        The impacts rules display information directly in the Potential Impacts
        table, and are also sometimes used as part of conditions for other rules.
        Their IDs are classified by sector: For example, "2a-iv-bio", which
        comes under the general impact of Reduced Water Supply, has management
        implications that appear under the Biodiversity sector.
        The rule, which is about the effect of a decrease in moisture
        availability on habitat, displays based on the condition that at least
        one season has a decrease in precipitation according to at least 75%
        of the climate model projections (strong agreement) is met.

        ### Notation

        | Item | Meaning |
        | - | - |
        | s0p/s50p/s100p | Spatial minimum/median/maximum 0.5° grid box value in the region. |
        | iastddev | Interannual standard deviation of the monthly, seasonal, or annual mean. |
        | hist | CRU TS 2.1 1961-1990 historical baseline. |
        | e25p/e75p | GCM ensemble 25th/75th percentile. This is always an interannual mean. |
        | ann, djf, mam, jja, son | Annual, Dec/Jan/Feb, Mar/Apr/May, Jun/Jul/Aug, Sep/Oct/Nov. |
        | anom | Value is an anomaly (not a percentage) from the baseline (i.e. future minus historical). |
        | percent | Value is a percentage anomaly from the baseline. |
        | rule_<rule-ID> | A reference to another rule. |
        | region_oncoast | Whether the region is on the coast. |
        | rule ? if_true : if_false | Checks whether a rule is true; if true, runs the clause represented by if_true; if false, runs the clause represented by if_false. |

        ### Variables

        | Variable | Description | Units |
        | - | - | - |
        | temp | Mean Temperature | °C |
        | prec | Total precipitation | mm/day |
        | pass | Snowfall | mm snow water equivalent |
        | dg05 | Growing DD (Degree-Days Above 5°C) | degree-days |
        | dl18 | Heating DD (Degree-Days Below 18°C) | degree-days |
        | nffd | Number of Frost-Free Days | days |

        If not otherwise specified, values are an interannual and spatial mean,
        and in the same units used on the maps (°C for temperatures, mm per day
        for precipitation, etc.).

        ### Rules

        Given a set of projected climate data (determined by the period, region,
        and time period you have selected), each rule evaluates to either true
        or false. If the rule is true, then that means the effect it signals
        is likely to occur in that scenario, and we say the rule is active.
        The effects signalled by active rules are summarized for easy
        interpretation in the By Category and By Sector tabs.

        In the table below, rules that are true for the
        region and time period selected have a white background;
        rules that are false have a grey background.

      This figure shows the range of projected change in
      ${season} ${variable.label} for ${region.properties.english_na}
      over three time periods
      (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s), according to a PCIC-standard set of
      GCM projections (see 'Notes' tab for more information).

      The range of change based on this set of climate projections is indicated
      as follows:

      - The black line indicates the mid-point (median) in the set.
      - The dark grey shading shows the middle 50% (25th to 75th percentiles),
        of the projections in the set.
      - The light grey shading shows the range of the central 80%
        (10th to 90th percentiles) of projections in the set.

      If you hover your mouse pointer over the graph, a popup will show values
      for the various percentile values. These values are shown only for the
      the central year of each averging period, since that is where we have
      data derived directly from observations or model runs (projections).
      Lines and bars at other years are interpolated from directly derived data
      and should be treated as more approximate.

      1. Information for the Summary and Impacts tabs is drawn from a set of
      projections from 12 different Global Climate Models (GCMs), each using one
      run of the RCP 8.5 (high emissions) greenhouse gas emissions scenario.
      This set of projections is referred to as the "ensemble." By the end of
      the 21st century, the RCP 8.5 scenario includes an atmospheric
      concentration of greenhouse gases, expressed as carbon dioxide (CO2)
      equivalent, of approximately 950 ppm Each GCM comes from a different
      modelling centre (e.g. the Hadley Centre (UK), National Centre for
      Atmospheric Research (USA), Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (USA),
      and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation
      (Australia), etc.).

      1. The Maps tab shows results for the ensemble average value of the
      selected variable.

      1. The 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s time periods are meant to be used as three
      representative planning horizons over the 21st century. Results for these
      three planning horizons are computed by averaging GCM projections over
      the 2010-2039, 2040-2069, and 2070-2099 periods, respectively.

      1. All variables shown here are computed from daily time series of
      downscaled climate simulations. Precipitation as snow is an approximation
      of snowfall based on total precipitation and temperature, and may provide
      different result than if snowfall was downscaled directly.

            body: |
              Plan2Adapt generates maps, plots, and data describing projected future climate conditions
              for regions throughout British Columbia.
              It is designed to help you assess climate change in your region based on a
              standard set of climate model projections.

              Plan2Adapt is similar to the [PCIC Climate Explorer](https://pacificclimate.org/analysis-tools/pcic-climate-explorer)
              and uses the same data to generate its output.
              With a simpler user interface and fewer configurable options Plan2Adapt is designed to
              serve the needs of those involved in local and regional community planning.

      Climate variables marked with &ast; are derived from temperature and/or
      precipitation values, and are not direct outputs of the climate models.
    lowBaseline: |
      Percent changes from a low baseline value can result in
      deceptively large percent change values.
      A small baseline can occur when the season and/or region
      together naturally make for zero or near-zero values. For example,
      snowfall in summer in low-lying southern areas.

    A [GCM (General Circulation Model)](http://www.ipcc-data.org/guidelines/pages/gcm_guide.html') is
    a numerical model representing
    physical processes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and land surface
    of the Earth.
    GCMs are the most advanced tools currently available for simulating the
    response of the global climate system to increasing greenhouse gas
    concentrations.
